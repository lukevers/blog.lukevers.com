On my laptop, I've generally used both Mac OS X and Debian Wheezy. I've tested out multiple distros of Linux before, including [Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/),[Debian](http://www.debian.org/), [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/), and now [Elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/). I was never a big fan of Mint; it reminded me too much of Windows XP. Ubuntu wasn't bad, but I always wanted to use genuine Debian instead of Ubuntu. I switched to Debian for a few months until today when I tried Elementary OS.

[Their website](http://elementaryos.org/) gave me high hopes that Elementary OS would be as great as it sounds, and so far from my experience today it has been. It has a clean, elegant design, while still being a very powerful operatying system. Elementary OS has a faster startup time than any operating system I have had, including OS X.

I use a Macbook Pro 9,2 as my laptop, dual booting Mac OS X and Linux. When I would run the LiveUSB with Mint, Ubuntu, or Debian, I would have to plug in a keyboard and mouse to my laptop, for they were not supported out of the box until the operating system was completely installed. With Elementary OS my keyboard and trackpad are immediately supported, including all of the special Apple buttons.

Overall it's hard to give a full report on everything about Elementary OS after less than one full day of use, but it seems to me that this might be the distro for me!
