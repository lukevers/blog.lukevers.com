I've had the iPad mini for maybe a week now. Before I even went out to buy it, I've had experience with the regular sized iPads, but I always felt that they were way too big to carry around without looking like you're slightly crazy. I wanted to buy it so I could put all my books for college on it instead of carrying books around. Carrying books around is just not fun in my opinion, and I'm not sure why I never did this in college before now.

So far I've enjoyed the iPad. I haven't had many problems with it as of right now either. The only thing that would be nice is if it could connect to a 4G network without having to pay for that. That being said, I should mention that I only got the wifi iPad becuase I did not want to pay for a plan for an iPad. That'd just be silly unless I was in places where I needed it.
