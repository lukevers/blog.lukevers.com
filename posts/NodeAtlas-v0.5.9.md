### What's new?

* The navbar is now translucent and matches everything else.
* The navbar has been split up into sections on the side, with drop down menus for map, filter, and tools.
* There's a new `filter` category! You can filter nodes based on the corresponding filters that you choose. To active it, just click "Off" on the filter drop down menu and it'll give you a list of options.
* The +/- buttons to zoom in/zoom out are now under the `map` category.
* The color of VPS nodes have been changed from gray to an orange-like color.
